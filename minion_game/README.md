# ðŸ§  The Minion Game â€“ Python Edition  

Welcome to **The Minion Game**, a fun and strategic word-based challenge between two players â€” **Kevin** and **Stuart** â€” inspired by the famous HackerRank problem.  
This version transforms that coding challenge into a **fully interactive Python project** with color-coded gameplay, automatic scoring, and a saved scoreboard.

## ðŸŽ® Game Concept  

In this game, both players are given the **same word**, and they earn points based on all possible substrings that can be made from it.  

- **Kevinâ€™s rule:** He scores points for all substrings that start with a **vowel** (A, E, I, O, U).  
- **Stuartâ€™s rule:** He scores points for all substrings that start with a **consonant** (any letter other than vowels).  

The number of points is determined by how many times a substring appears in the original word.  
This concept tests your understanding of **string manipulation, loops, and substring generation** in Python â€” while turning it into an actual playable game!

## ðŸ§© Game Logic Explained  

If the given string is `"BANANA"`:
- Kevin gets points for substrings starting with vowels: `A`, `AN`, `ANA`, etc.
- Stuart gets points for substrings starting with consonants: `B`, `BA`, `BAN`, etc.

Instead of generating all substrings (which would be slow), we use an optimized approach:  
Every letter contributes `(len(string) - index)` possible substrings.
